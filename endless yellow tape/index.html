                <p>In the main games, Pikmin are created by Onions, which produce them as seeds, which in turn fall to the ground and become sprouts. A leader then may pluck one of these sprouts. Once plucked, Pikmin follow a leader around the area or cave in their squad, and the leader can throw them at objects, as well as dismiss, swarm, and charge them. When out of a leader's squad, they can be whistled back into it. Through these basic actions, Pikmin can be ordered to carry items or fight enemies, among other abilities.
